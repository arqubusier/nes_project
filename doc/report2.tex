% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

The livestock industry constitutes a considerable part of the world’s economy.
In fact, it generates some € 8.6 billion every year in the Netherlands alone.
~\cite{ned_gov} At the same time, there is a clear trend of automatization in
this sector that aims to increase the efficiency and decrease the amount of
human labour.

However, one of the major costs for the farmers in this field, is diseases
contracted by their animals. By developing a system that could detect such
diseases, and other abnormal behavior, one could potentially reduce this costs
by a great amount.  


\subsection{Application Description}

The main purpose of this project is to design a system that can help farmers
monitor the health of cattle while they are grazing. This will be done using
wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, because of its ability to deliver
real-time monitoring at a very low cost.  However, on account of range
limitations of WSN transceivers, the system will be designed for a relatively
small field of 10 ha which is in the range of an average dairy farm in the
Netherlands ~\cite{agricultural_systems}.

The network of the system will consist of three types of nodes: a base station,
which acts as a data sink; sensor nodes, one for each head of cattle, recording
health characteristics; and a number of relay nodes on fixed positions in the
field, forwarding data from the sensor nodes to the base station. The reason
for using relay nodes, is to be able to cover the majority of the field.

The system will be used both to detect different types of diseases: fever,
lameness and mastitis, and to detect if a cow is in estrus.  This can be
accomplished by the use accelerometer-, microphone-, and temperature sensors in
the sensor nodes.~\cite{hese2014}  Every 4 minutes, the sensor nodes will send the acquired
data in a processed form to the base station for storage. The base station can
analyse the sample values to detect patterns that correspond to different
diseases or the onset of estrus.

\subsection{Related Work}


\section{Application Specific Challenges}


\section{Scope}


\section{Requirements}

To ensure that the designed system can meet the needs of real-world usage, it
needs to meet the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate} 

    \item The network must be implemented in such a way that If a sensor node
        moves out of coverage of the network, the sensor node will be
        reassigned to the network once it moves into coverage again.  
        
    \item The end-to-end latency between the sensor nodes and the base station
        must be less than 1 minute for at least 90 \% of data packets.
        
    \item For every sensor node at least 70 \% of the recorded sensor data must
        be delivered to the base station every 12 hours.
        
    \item The time until the first sensor node of the network fails must be
        greater than one year.  
        
    \item The network must function and be scalable for up to 100 sensor nodes.
        
    \item The network must continue to function whether nodes are added or
        removed.
    
    \item When out of coverage, each sensor node must be able to store sensor
        values for a period of up to four hours.
    
    \item  sensor node must not be out of coverage for more than four hours at
        a time.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Data size}

One of the most important requirements for the system is to be able to handle
the amount of data generated by the sensors. Estimating this amount is thus
also very important. For storing the temperature of the cow after processing
the raw data from the sensors, one byte is enough to give a reasonable
resolution. This is because a dairy cow’s normal rectal temperature lies
between 38.3 and 38.9 centigrades ~\cite{wiki_bov} and one could limiting the
byte to represent values between 30 and 50 degrees centigrades without losing
any information.  Using the same argumentation, one byte could also be used to
store the average heart rate, because the normal heart rate for a dairy cow
lies between 40 and 84 beats per minute ~\cite{wiki_bov}.

In addition, to store the data gathered from the accelerometers, one could
devise a similar strategy to the one used in a study where the behaviour of
sows were classified.\cite{marchioro_sows_2011} In this study, the activities
of the animals were organized into four different sets, using a method
specifically developed for low powered embedded devices. This resulted in
a classification with an accuracy of close to 90 \%. Using data in this format,
the researchers were able to detect the onset of farrowing. In this study only
four sets of behaviours were used, if it is possible to develop similar sets
for behavioural studies on cows, one could potentially store this data using
only two bits per sample.

Using two samples for both the temperature and the heart rate, while also
rounding up to the nearest byte, total amount of data needed to be sent each
five minute interval would be five bytes.


\section{Protocol Stack}

The system will developed for platforms supporting ContikiOs. For the
physical- and MAC layers, the standard protocol IEEE 802.15.4
\cite{ieee_computer_society_ieee_2011} will be used.  For the network- and
application layer, features from ContikiOs will be used.  Moreover, a routing
algorithm might possibly be designed, if the routing algorithms present in
ContikiOs are deemed unfitting for our application.

\subsection{Physical Layer}

To mitigate the problems with coverage, tranceivers with carrier frequencies
between 902 and 928 of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, will be considered in order
to get an increased range. Even though these frequencies provide a lower
datarate, of around 40 kbp/s \cite{ieee_computer_society_ieee_2011}, it is
still sufficient for the small amounts of data collected by the sensors.
Furthermore, the modulation scheme to be used will either be ASK-, BPSK or
O-QPSK.

\subsection{MAC Layer}

For the MAC layer, there are two modes to be used in the IEEE 802.15.4
standard: nonbeacon-enabled mode and beacon-enabled mode. In the former
a unslotted CSMA/CA mechanism is used. In the latter one, a more elaborate
scheme is used, wherein special nodes of the network, called coordinators,
regularly send out beacons to synchronize the nodes it is associated with. The
period between two beacons is called a superframe, and within this the nodes
use a slotted CSMA/CA mechanism.

Because of the need for synchronization, the beacon-enabled mode might cause
problems if a sensor node moves out of coverage of a coordinator for a longer
period of time, or if a sensor node needs to switch to a different coordinator.
The sensor node might have to listen for a very long time to receive the next
beacon, possibly even the whole time while it is out of range, thus consuming
a lot of power.

On the other hand, the unslotted CSMA/CA mechanism of the nonbeacon-enabled
mode, in addition to being less complex, does not require the nodes associated
with a coordinator to regularly receive a beacon, and is thus suitable for the
mobile nature of our application. The only drawback is the power consumption
required for continuously listening at regular intervals.  However, since the
relay nodes and the base station are the only ones that need to receive data,
only these have to listen, and not the sensor nodes. In view of these
arguments, the design will use the nonbeacon-enabled mode.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
