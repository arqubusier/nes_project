	abstract = {Abstract: The protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN) were defined in IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006. In this revision, the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4 is extended, the ambiguities in the standard are removed, and the improvements learned from implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006 are included. Keywords: ad hoc network, IEEE 802.15.4, low data rate, low power, LR-WPAN, mobility, PAN, personal area network, radio frequency, RF, short range, wireless, wireless personal area network, WPAN.},
